# *Snakemake workflow for TritonNP*

## Description
From *Triton*, the Greek god of waves, and N(ucleosome) P(hasing). This workflow will run TritonNP on matched BAM and (optional) GC-correction files for regions of interest, generating nucleosome phasing metrics and region-level figures as outputs.

This tool has been updated! For the newest version, which now includes fragmentomic analyses, check out: https://github.com/GavinHaLab/Triton  
However, f you are looking to reproduce LuCaP PDX phasing analyses from https://doi.org/10.1158/2159-8290.CD-22-0692 you are in the right place.

## Requirements
### Software packages or libraries
  - Python 3.7.4
    - Snakemake 5.19.2
    - Pysam 0.15.4
    - Argparse 1.1
    - Numpy 1.17.3
    - Pandas 0.25.3
    - Scipy 1.4.1

### Scripts
  - GenerateFFTFeatures.py (primary tool for extracting phasing features)
  - CombinePhasingFM.py (combines output files into a single feature matrix)
  - GenerateGCSamples.py (optional; found in config/; used for combining sample info with GC-bias data from Griffin)

### Griffin-based GC correction
TritonNP optionally takes BAM-matched GC bias data produced by the Griffin workflow; the workflow with instructions for generating bias files can be
found at https://github.com/GavinHaLab/Griffin (when used in the snakemake as opposed to a stand-alone tool GC bias is required).

## Sample list
Sample names with paths to matching BAM and GC_bias files should be defined in a YAML file. See `PhasingAnalysis/config/samples.yaml` for an example.
This file may also be generated automatically based on a directory full of BAMs and a path to matched GC_bias files using `GenerateGCSamples.py` as a
stand-alone script.
```
samples:
  sample_1:
    bam: /path/to/sample_1.bam
    GC_bias: /path/to/sample_1.GC_bias.txt
```

## Snakefiles
1. `GenerateFFTFeatures.snakefile`

### [config.yaml] (PhasingAnalysis/config/config.yaml)
See below for details on [config.yaml] (`PhasingAnalysis/config/config.yaml`)

## Run the analysis
### 1. Invoking the full snakemake workflow on a cluster using 'slurm'
There is only one file in use for `slurm`:
  `PhasingAnalysis/config/cluster_slurm.yaml` - This file contains memory, runtime, and number of cores for each task.
To invoke the snakemake pipeline for `qsub`:
```
snakemake -s GenerateFFTFeatures.snakefile --latency-wait 60 --keep-going --cluster-config config/cluster_slurm.yaml --cluster "sbatch -p {cluster.partition} --mem={cluster.mem} -t {cluster.time} -c {cluster.ncpus} -n {cluster.ntasks} -o {cluster.output} -J {cluster.JobName}" -j 40
```

### 2. Using the tool as a stand-alone
GenerateFFTFeatures.py may also be run as a stand-alone script to retrieve features of an individual BAM file, with or without GC_bias, on a local
machine. Once dependencies are loaded run `python GenerateFFTFeatures.py -h` (help) to see all available options, which have more detailed explanations
below in the configuration and settings section.

## Configuration and settings
All (default) settings for the workflow are contained in [config.yaml] (`PhasingAnalysis/config/config.yaml`), while cluster settings and sample
paths are found in `PhasingAnalysis/config/cluster_slurm.yaml` and `PhasingAnalysis/config/samples.yaml`, respectively.

### sites_bed
Path to BED file containing regions of interest

### results_dir
Path to the output directory (default: results)

### reference_genome
Path to GRCh38 reference genome for GC calculation (.fa)

### plot_list
Text file with a list of region-names to generate plots for (may be left empty)

### size_range
Tuple of ints for minimum and maximum fragment sizes to use; defaults to (15, 500)

### map_quality
Int defining the minimum read mapping qualilty to keep
